This is the readme for my first portfolio project for the CS course in codecademy, wherein I am tasked with
making a terminal game using python.

Name: Terminal Taxi
Description: A text-based taxi driving simulator for terminal written in Python 3.10.1 
Installation: dunno yet . . .

Roadmap:

1. Impliment movement! 
-basic movement working
-will add "set speed option"

2. Create playspace and map -- Will use a grid scheme to create visitable desitnations and boundaries.  
-Added location class
-Added basic logic for location detection using "check position" command in-game. 
-Locations will be fixed 
-Currently working on implenting boundaries ...

Current List of Locations for Refference ('O' means they've been added to the game):

Starting Position - X: 2, Y: 4

Location 1 - X: 3-5, Y: 10-14 			O
Location 2 - X: 6-8, Y: 10-13 			O
Location 3 - X: 9-13, Y: 10-13			O
Location 4 - X: 15-17, Y: 10-14		 	O	
Location 5 - X: 18-21, Y: 10-13			O
Location 6 - X: 22-24 Y: 10-13			O
Location 7 - X: 25-27 Y: 10-13			O
Location 8 - X: 2-5 Y: 7-9			    O
Location 9 - X: 2-5 Y: 4-6			    O
Location 10 - X: 6-9 Y: 6-8			    O
Location 11 - X: 8-10 Y: 7-8			O		
Location 12 - X: 11-14 Y: 7-9			O
Location 13 - X: 9-13 Y: 4-6			O
