This is the readme for my first portfolio project for the CS course in codecademy, wherein I am tasked with
making a terminal game using python.

Name: Terminal Taxi
Description: A text-based taxi driving simulator for terminal written in Python 3.10.1 
Installation: dunno yet . . .

Roadmap:

1. Impliment movement! - Done - Movement uses a series of commands centered around the cardinal directions and uses an x/y
grid to keep track of player position. - Taxi can "turn left" and "turn right" and "accelerate" or "reverse". 
*may make this more nuanced later . . .

2. Build customer generator!
